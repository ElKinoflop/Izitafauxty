<img src="https://github.com/ElKinoflop//blob/main/images/PXL_20241018_081939565~2.jpg" alt="Izitafauxty Keyboard Photo">

Stacked acrylic keyboard case designed for handwiring with a <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RP2040-Tiny" target="_blank">Waveshare RP2040-Tiny</a>. Main cluster is minivan sized with an added F-Row and numpad (standard or southpaw).

Feel free to do whatever you want with the files. If you have any questions just ask (Discord username elkinoflop) and if you make one then share a photo with me!

<h1>Case</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Designed to be cut from 3mm acrylic</li>
</ul>

<h1>Bill of Materials</h1>
<ul>
  <li>One of each DXF file (except for the plate) cut from 3mm acrylic.</li>
  <li>Plate DXF file cut from 1.5mm metal/carbon. Plastic is not suggested as it will be too flexy and your switches will probably pop out</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RP2040-Tiny" target="_blank">Waveshare RP2040-Tiny</a></li>
  <li>M2 Standoffs with a outside diameter of 3mm. Various lengths. <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/8H1HG6Y" target="_blank">Amazon Standoffs</a></li></li>
  <li>M2 Hex socket button head bolts. 5, 6 and 8mm lengths. <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32969042589.html" target="_blank">AliExpress bolts</a></li>
  <li>M2 Washers. To space the plate downwards to tune the keycap height (normally 2mm worth under each plate mounting bolt). Also for under the bolt heads that hold the daughterboard in.<a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003697132040.html" target="_blank">AliExpress M2 0.5mm thickness plastic washers</a></li>
<li>M2 nuts to hold the daughterboard. Included with the standoffs linked above</li>
  <li>Wire! Solid core 22 AWG suggested</li>
  <li>73x MX Switches</li>
  <li>73x 1N4148 Diodes</li>
</ul>

<h1>Firmware</h1>
I used <a href="https://pog.heaper.de/" target="_blank">POG</a>  to create <a href="https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware" target="_blank">KMK</a> firmware. POG makes creating firmware super simple but I might learn how to create QMK/VIAL firmware at some point!
I have included my firmware files (generated by POG). 

If you have wired up the matrix and connected it to the same controller pins as I have then you should be able to use my firmware. Install <a href="https://circuitpython.org/board/waveshare_rp2040_tiny/" target="_blank">Circuit Python</a> onto the controller first and then copy all the files from <a href="https://github.com/ElKinoflop/Izitafauxty/tree/main/KMK%20Firmware" target="_blank">'KMK Firmware' onto the drive</a>

<h1>Handwired Matrix</h1>
This is how I handwired the Matrix. Excuse the poor soldering (and out of focus photo). The second photo shows the controller and LEDs wired up too.

<h1>Case Assembly</h1>
Depending on the cutting of the acrylic you might find some of the standoffs tight to push through. Don't force them through. If needed use a small round file useful just to very slightly widen a couple of holes. The small round file from Draper 'Soft Grip Needle File Set, 140mm (6 Piece) (83982)' is the perfect size.
